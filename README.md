# 2048


## What is this?

It's 2048, written in Python by the Ladue High School Computer Science Club. It' still in its early stages, so expect bugs!


## Getting started

Download or clone this repo, then run `python main.py`.

If Python complains about `termcolor`, install it with `pip install termcolor`.
